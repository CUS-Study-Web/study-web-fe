# Code Conventions

This project uses React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## General Rules

- Prefer functional React components.
- Use TypeScript for props, state, and shared data shapes.
- Keep code small, readable, and easy to scan.
- Follow the current folder structure in [FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md](../FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md).
- Put each feature in the most specific folder that owns it.

## React Rules

- Keep components focused on one responsibility.
- Move reusable UI into `src/components/`.
- Keep page-level composition in `src/pages/`.
- Use `src/hooks/` for custom hooks.
- Use `src/contexts/` only for shared state that truly needs to cross multiple parts of the app.
- Put API and data access code in `src/services/`.

## TypeScript Rules

- Type component props explicitly.
- Prefer `type` for component props and local data shapes unless an `interface` is clearly better.
- Avoid `any` unless there is no practical alternative.
- Use narrow types and keep unions small and meaningful.
- Do not overuse type assertions; fix the data shape instead.

## Styling Rules

- Use Tailwind CSS for layout and routine styling.
- Keep class lists readable and avoid unnecessary duplication.
- Extract reusable UI when a class list becomes hard to maintain.
- Keep global styles in `src/index.css` or `src/styles/` when needed.

## Naming Rules

- Use PascalCase for React components and component files.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, hooks, and utilities.
- Name hooks with the `use` prefix.
- Use clear feature-oriented names instead of generic names like `data` or `stuff`.

## Accessibility Rules

- Use semantic HTML first.
- Add labels, alt text, and button types where needed.
- Make interactive elements keyboard accessible.
- Preserve focus states and visible hover states.

## Working Rules

- Check the nearest existing file before adding a new one.
- Prefer editing the file that owns the behavior instead of adding extra wrappers.
- Keep changes consistent with the current project structure.
- Validate code with `npm run build` and, when relevant, `npm run lint`.

## When to Read This File

Read this file before making code changes that affect component structure, typing, styling, or shared architecture.
